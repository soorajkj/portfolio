                Hello! My name is{" "}
                <b className="text-neutral-300">Sooraj Janardhanan</b> and I
                enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My interest in
                web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try
                editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a
                custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

                Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at
                an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a
                student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building
                accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at
                Upstatement for a variety of clients.

                I also recently launched a course that covers everything you
                need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.
